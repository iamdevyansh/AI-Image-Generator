This project is an AI Image Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a text description, and then, using the OpenAI API, generates a set of images based on that description.
The generated images are displayed in a gallery format, and users can download the images they like. The application opens with a dedicated section for image generation, featuring a prominent heading introducing the purpose of the tool. A descriptive paragraph outlines the functionality, encouraging users to convert their textual prompts into visually appealing images. A well-designed form allows users to input their desired image description. The form also includes a dropdown menu enabling users to specify the quantity of images they wish to generate. Clear and concise placeholder text guides users on the type of input expected. The form is equipped with interactive controls, including a submit button that triggers the image generation process. A visually intuitive loading state is incorporated, providing users with real-time feedback during the generation phase. Once the images are generated, they are elegantly presented in the gallery section. Each image is encapsulated within a dedicated card, featuring both the generated image and a download button for easy access.
